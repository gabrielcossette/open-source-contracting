## A Model template texts for tenders ##

This short annex provides some templates for text that
can be used while preparing tenders for the procurement
of open source software and software based on open
standards. This annex should be read as a source of
possible implementation of the recommendations
provided in section 2.4 of the main guideline, "Purchasing
open source software".
Naturally, the texts here may require some adaptation for
inclusion in tenders, depending on the precise policies
and requirements applicable to each public agency and
each tender. The texts are provided following a checkbox
approach, allowing the reader to combine texts as
appropriate.


### A.1 Functional / Technical specifications ###

Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide ready-to-use
texts for functional specifications - the core component of
any tender. The authors can only emphasize here how
important it is to further good practices and apply the
principles of procurement by using clear and precise
functional specifications, rather than brand names or
product names, although open standards could be cited
by name.


### A.2 Open source requirements ###

Following functional specifications for the software, the
authors recommend that open source requirements be
placed not in the functional specifications, but as separate
requirements in the contract documents (cahier de charges)
or contract subject matter description, if they are
mandatory, and as weighted award criteria, if the open
source requirements are preferential rather than
mandatory.

#### Open source requirements ####

The following text could be included.
The ownership of the supplied software, including all
associated intellectual property rights, is to be
transferred to the contracting agency with no restrictions on what the contracting agency may do with it ^23^ ; OR, the software is to be supplied to the contracting agency
under the following terms and conditions: 
1. the software may be used by the agency for any
purpose the agency sees fit

2. the contractor will provide the complete source
code and documentation for the software so that
the software can be studied by the contracting
agency or any third party or parties of its choice

3. the software may be modified by the contracting
agency or any third party or parties of its choice

4. the contracting agency may distribute the
software, with source code and modifications, to
any party of its choice, under terms and
conditions allowing such parties the same
freedoms retained by the contracting agency, as
described above, to use, study, modify and
redistribute the software.

If the supplied software is required to be open source
The open source requirements as shown above should be
included in the contract documents (cahier de charges) 
or contract subject matter description as mandatory
requirements.

If the supplied software is preferred but not required to be open
source

The open source requirements should be included as a
weighted award criterion. A weighting/scoring system
should be used. The weight for the above open source
criterion should be set to the level of preference for open
source deemed appropriate for the tender, depending on
the justifications and requirements. For example, suppose
the weight for the open source criterion is set at 20%, and
that the winner selection formula is the total quality score
divided by the total price at a 1:1 price : quality weighting.
In that case, if two competing bids, one for proprietary
software and one for open source software, exactly match
in terms of quality and other award criteria, the open
source bid will be selected unless the proprietary bid has
a price that is 20% lower. In this case, the public agency
believes the value of the open source properties of the
software are worth a 20% premium in the immediate
price of the tender (e.g. due to presumed long-term cost
advantages that are not included in the tender price)

^23^ - While a transfer of rights to the acquirer is not the same as an open source licence, it fulfils
the same procurement requirements; this follows the principle of this guideline that tender
terms follow the requirements of the procuring agency, and open source follows from these
requirements. Of course, if a procuring agency acquires all rights to the software, it is free to
release the software as open source so that other public agencies (among others) share the
benefits.
