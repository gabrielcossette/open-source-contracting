# [The Sharing and Reuse Framework for IT Solutions](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/sharing_and_reuse_of_it_solutions_framework_final.pdf): Fostering collaboration among public administrations

There is a lot of value in this document, but highlighting elements focused on open-source. 

## 4. Promote legal certainty 

### Context

Uncertainty  with  regard  to  the  liability  exposure  of  relevant  stakeholders  and  
the  infringement  of  property  rights  assigned  through,  for  example,  copyright  
and patents, negatively impact the sharing and reuse of IT solutions.

In  order  to  reduce  the  degree  of  legal  uncertainty  about  intellectual  property  
rights’  limitations  and  exceptions,  public  administrations  are  encouraged  to  
follow the recommendations listed below.

### 4.1. Use standard templates for liability agreements
To  facilitate  collaborative  software  development  and  cooperation  between  
project partners, the use of standard templates for liability agreements is recommended.

Standard templates are practical tools such as licence, consortium and collaboration 
agreements. These templates make it easier for public administrations to adopt 
the suitable approach to intellectual property rights and licensing of IT solutions, 
which, in turn, increases the potential for their sharing and reuse.

### 4.2. Decide the type of rights’ attribution approach to be used as early as possible and inform all involved

The use of certificates of origin and collaboration agreements provides 
developers with guidelines on the requirements to be followed when contributing 
to  the  development  and  maintenance  of  IT  solutions.  It  also  ensures  that  the  
guardian  of  a  project’s  output  has  the  necessary  ownership  or  rights  over  
all  contributions  to  ensure  further  distribution  under  the  chosen  licence.  It  is  
important that rights are attributed as early in the process as possible because 
later amendments may prove difficult or impossible. Clarity on the attribution of 
rights provides consumers with some form of legal assurance of the provenance 
and integrity of their contribution.

The  joint  development  of  IT  solutions  can  be  successful  with  either  a  central  or  
decentralised  control  structure  although  each  approach  has  its  limitations.  For  
instance,  where  there  is  central  control  of  intellectual  property  rights,  better  
coordination  is  achieved  but  it  is  possible  that  developers  are  discouraged  from  
contributing.  Where  developers  are  allowed  to  retain  property  rights,  they  are  
motivated to contribute but issues of control over the broad IT solution may arise.
Additional constraints should also be taken into account. For instance, it is often 
technically impossible for public administrations to give away rights.

### 4.3. Use existing open source software licences to share your IT solution

Public administrations should use licences with the least legal friction possible, 
i.e.  with  the  minimum  possible  restrictions  in  terms  of  sharing  and  reuse  of  
software. This is best done by using open source licences, such as the EUPL.
Furthermore,  to  limit  incompatibilities  between  licences  and  promote  legal  
interoperability  of  IT  solutions,  public  administrations  should  reuse  existing  
licences instead of writing their own. 

### 4.4. Detect licence compatibility issues
Currently, hundreds of licences are recognised as open and are used by public 
administrations around the world. Such a proliferation of licences may lead to 
compatibility issues, which could limit the sharing and reuse of IT solutions. When 
merging  two  pieces  of  software  code  with  different  licences,  for  example,  the  
restrictions imposed by a first licence may not be compatible with the restrictions 
imposed by a second one, making it impossible to use the combined solution.
In  order  to  reduce  this  risk,  it  is  important  that  public  administrations  
detect licence incompatibilities as early as possible, for example, with the support 
of specific tools.

Recommended measures for central bodies
- Select and promote the use of appropriate licences
To  enable  the  reuse  of  IT  solutions,  central  bodies  should  select  appropriate  licences and licence templates, and promote their use.
- Provide support on matters related to intellectual property rights and licensing
By providing practical advice in these areas, central bodies can support public 
administrations  dealing  with  intellectual  property  rights  and  licensing  issues  
related to the sharing and reuse of IT solutions. This may include, for example, 
helping them to better understand the rights and obligations associated with a 
given solution and to identify whether a third party holds any rights to it.

## 5. Procure IT solutions in a transparent and open way

### Context

When  procuring  IT  solutions,  public  administrations  are  often  restricted  by  
compatibility  requirements  of  existing  proprietary  interfaces,  systems  and  
data  formats  or  they  simply  underestimate  the  benefits  of  relying  on  
open specifications and standards. 

This situation often results in poor procurement practices limiting competition, such as:
- referencing  non-standard  specifications,  which  only  a  few  vendors  know about and can comply with;
- referencing  specific  sources,  trademarks,  patents,  etc.,  favouring  certain  companies or products.

These practices sometimes result in one vendor providing critical systems for many 
years and subsequently being difficult to move away from. Such vendor lock-in is 
estimated to cost European public administrations € 1.1 billion a year. Aside from 
increasing costs, it reduces the available vendor base, excludes new and innovative 
companies from providing alternative solutions and causes the market to stagnate.

### 5.1. Use common standards and specifications in IT procurement
Using standards and open specifications is crucial to avoid vendor lock-in. In the 
context  of  IT  procurement,  public  administrations  should  consider  referencing  
European  and  national  standards  or  international  IT  specifications
identified by the European Commission.

Using common standards and open specifications:
- Reduces the technical work needed to link IT systems together;
- Results in cost savings due to lower maintenance and integration costs;
- Increases competition in the EU’s Digital Single Market.

### 5.2. Share assessments of standards and technical specifications
In  the  context  of  IT  procurement,  public  administrations  should  
assess  and select the most appropriate standards and specifications.
Furthermore, by  sharing  their  assessments  of  standards  and  technical  
specifications with others, public administrations promote a more efficient use 
of  public  funds,  reduce  duplication  of  work  and  improve  transparency  in  the  
procurement process.

A  good  way  of  sharing  assessment  findings  is  to  create  a
common  list  of standards and specifications along with their assessments so that they can be 
reused by different public administrations.

### 5.3. Use standard clauses and contractual templates that facilitate 
the sharing and reuse of IT solutions
The use of standard clauses and contractual templates is a common practice in 
public administrations. Emphasis should be given to making ‘sharing and reuse’ 
part of these clauses.

This way, vendor lock-in can be avoided. Similarly, the degree of legal certainty and 
the potential for the procured IT solution to be shared with other administrations 
will  be  increased.  As  such,  clauses  are  usually  issued  by  institutions  and  
organisations that are experts in the field and are drafted in a way that leaves 
little room for different interpretation. Public administrations should, therefore, 
develop standard clauses or reuse already existing ones.

### 5.4. Open source software: take into account community contribution in public procurement
The involvement of communities in the development and maintenance 
of IT solutions fosters competition between service providers, especially when 
large communities can contribute instead of one single company.
One of the main strengths of open source software is that the development process, 
at its best, involves a community of several firms, individuals and other contributors. 
Contribution  is  not  limited  to  writing  code;  it  extends  to,  for  instance,  providing  
detailed reports of requirements and issues as well as examples and tutorials.
Public  administrations  can  also  provide  indirect  support  to  the  open  source  
community  by  asking  tenderers  that  have  selected  open  source  software  to  
demonstrate their level of contribution to the relevant developer community.

#### Recommended measures for central bodies
- Support the use of common standards and specifications
Central  bodies  should  encourage  the  use  of  common  standards  and  technical  
specifications in public procurement, for example, by creating a common list of 
such specifications.
