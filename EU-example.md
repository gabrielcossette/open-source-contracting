## A Model template texts for tenders ##

This short annex provides some templates for text that
can be used while preparing tenders for the procurement
of open source software and software based on open
standards. This annex should be read as a source of
possible implementation of the recommendations
provided in section 2.4 of the main guideline, "Purchasing
open source software".
Naturally, the texts here may require some adaptation for
inclusion in tenders, depending on the precise policies
and requirements applicable to each public agency and
each tender. The texts are provided following a checkbox
approach, allowing the reader to combine texts as
appropriate.


### A.1 Functional / Technical specifications ###

Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide ready-to-use
texts for functional specifications - the core component of
any tender. The authors can only emphasize here how
important it is to further good practices and apply the
principles of procurement by using clear and precise
functional specifications, rather than brand names or
product names, although open standards could be cited
by name.


### A.2 Open source requirements ###

Following functional specifications for the software, the
authors recommend that open source requirements be
placed not in the functional specifications, but as separate
requirements in the contract documents (cahier de charges)
or contract subject matter description, if they are
mandatory, and as weighted award criteria, if the open
source requirements are preferential rather than
mandatory.

#### Open source requirements ####

The following text could be included.

_The ownership of the supplied software, including all associated intellectual property rights, is to be transferred to the contracting agency with no restrictions on what the contracting agency may do with it <sup>23</sup> ; OR, the software is to be supplied to the contracting agency under the following terms and conditions:_

_1. the software may be used by the agency for any purpose the agency sees fit_

_2. the contractor will provide the complete source code and documentation for the software so that the software can be studied by the contracting agency or any third party or parties of its choice_

_3. the software may be modified by the contracting agency or any third party or parties of its choice_

_4. the contracting agency may distribute the software, with source code and modifications, to any party of its choice, under terms and conditions allowing such parties the same freedoms retained by the contracting agency, as described above, to use, study, modify and redistribute the software._

#### If the supplied software is required to be open source ####

The open source requirements as shown above should be
included in the contract documents (cahier de charges) 
or contract subject matter description as mandatory
requirements.

#### If the supplied software is preferred but not required to be open source ####

The open source requirements should be included as a
weighted award criterion. A weighting/scoring system
should be used. The weight for the above open source
criterion should be set to the level of preference for open
source deemed appropriate for the tender, depending on
the justifications and requirements. For example, suppose
the weight for the open source criterion is set at 20%, and
that the winner selection formula is the total quality score
divided by the total price at a 1:1 price : quality weighting.
In that case, if two competing bids, one for proprietary
software and one for open source software, exactly match
in terms of quality and other award criteria, the open
source bid will be selected unless the proprietary bid has
a price that is 20% lower. In this case, the public agency
believes the value of the open source properties of the
software are worth a 20% premium in the immediate
price of the tender (e.g. due to presumed long-term cost
advantages that are not included in the tender price)

### A.3 Open standards requirements ###

Along with functional specifcations for the software, the
standards must be described in the technical
specifcations of the tender. Each standard must be
defned by reference (or name), if it is an offcial standard
that is permissible to cite this way, or a widely known
specifcation that is not a formal standards in the
European legal sense, but can be described by name:
TCP/IP, HTML, XML, SMTP, etc. 

It should already be known at the point of preparing the
tender whether or not any given named standards meet
the openness requirements of that tender. Thus, standards
that do not meet such requirements can simply not be
listed in the technical specifcations.

Although it is preferable to name specifc open standards
in the technical specifcations, if the technical interfaces,
formats or protocols cannot be named – e.g. if no named
open standards exist – they must be defned in the
technical specifcations. Each standard thus defned must
be clearly identifed in the technical specifcations, for
example, each defned (unnamed) standard can be numbered, using text such as:

** "This specifcation is referred to in this call for tenders as Open Standard #1" **

#### Open standards requirements ####

Standards which are named in the functional
specifcations have presumably been screened for their
openness attributes prior to the tender procedure. This
may have been done at the European, national, regional
or local level, or by the procuring agency itself. Thus, if
only named standards are being used, there is no need for
the tender to include requirements specifying the
openness of standards. The named standards have been
assumed to meet any procurement requirements.

If interfaces, protocols or formats are defned in
functional terms in the technical specifcations, as
described above, openness requirements may need to be
included in the tender in order to ensure the openness of
any implementation. This may also be required if the
technical specifcations of the tender do not detail all the
standards that may be included in a procured solution.
For example, the call for tenders may require bidders to
propose the standards they intend to use, and evaluate
each bid on the basis of the openness of the technologies
proposed. In this case, the openness could be specifed in
award criteria.

There is no universally accepted defnition of open
standards; this guide has used the defnition of the
European Interoperability Framework version 1.0.
However, a defnition of open standards is not required
in order to actually have tenders preferring or requiring
open standards, if each tender actually includes justifable
requirements or award criteria for the openness of
standards.

Here the authors provide text consistent with the EIF v1.0
defnition of open standards, but this text stands on its
own independent of any external defnitions.

Thus, the following texts could be included as tender requirements
or as a weighted award criterion.

_If the technical specifcation functionally defines unnamed but
numbered protocols, interfaces or formats_

The following text could be included as part of the
requirements for openness of standards:

_The supplied solution must implement the technologies
referred to in the Technical Specifcations as Open
Standards #1 [#2, #3 etc]. Each of these technologies, as
implemented in the supplied solution, must have the
following properties:_

If the technical specifcations do not include standards, but
allow the bidder to propose various technologies and standards
in their proposal

The following text could be included as part of the
requirements for openness of standards:

_The supplied solution may implement a number of
standards, interfaces, protocols or formats, each of
which, as implemented in the supplied software, must
have the following properties:_

Openness properties for standards

For either case above, the provided text should be
followed by the openness properties for open standards:

**1. it is implementable by all potential providers of equivalent technologies**
**2. its past and future development is open and transparent**
**3. there is no restriction on its re-use**

Note these openness requirements must be justifable due
to the interoperability needs of the procuring agency.
Moreover, if it is not seen as essential or justifed to be
consistent with the EIF v1.0 defnition of open standards,
it is possible to use some of these properties alone, or to
separate them into individual weighted award criteria
rather than combining them into a single one. That way,
bids that meet some of the properties of open standards
will still get some weighted score, even if they do not
meet all the properties.

_If the supplied software is required to use open standards_

The open standards requirements – or named, open
standards, if specifed – should be included in 
the contract documents  (cahier de charges) or contract subject
matter description as mandatory requirements. 

_If the supplied software is preferred but not required to be implementing open standards_

The open standards requirements, or named open
standards if specifed, should be included as weighted
award criterion. A weighting/scoring system should be
used. The weight for the open standards requirement
should be set to the level of preference for open standards
deemed appropriate for the tender, depending on the
justifcations and requirements. 

Weighting and scoring can also be used if not all the
properties of open standards as translated into award
criteria are seen as equally important or essential. For
instance, if it is seen as essential that the standards is
equally implementable by all potential providers of
equivalent technologies, and that there is no constraint on
re-use, but the transparency of development while
preferred is not essential, the openness attributes could be
separately listed with #1 and #3 being obligatory and #2
being weighted.



<sup>23</sup> - While a transfer of rights to the acquirer is not the same as an open source licence, it fulfils
the same procurement requirements; this follows the principle of this guideline that tender
terms follow the requirements of the procuring agency, and open source follows from these
requirements. Of course, if a procuring agency acquires all rights to the software, it is free to
release the software as open source so that other public agencies (among others) share the
benefits.
