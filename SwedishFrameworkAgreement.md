## Terms and Conditions ##

When procuring software and services under the framework agreement, a predefined set of terms and
conditions automatically becomes part of the contract. These are comparable to conditions traditionally 
used in IT procurement, apart from the following terms specifically related to open source:

- The customer receives non-exclusive and indefinite rights to the Result, including a right to copy,
modify, correct, and further develop the Result. The customer has the right to hire third parties in
order to utilize the Result in accordance with the specified terms of use.
- The supplier must indicate to what extent the software license affects the customer’s rights to the
Result.
- The supplier shall within 30 days after the customer’s acceptance of delivery provide all changes
and additions back to the relevant communities. When the supplier provides the changes and
additions, they must adhere to the conditions and practices of the community or company behind
the software.
- The supplier is not entitled to transfer or assign the rights to the Result to the customer on terms
that restrict, or goes beyond, the terms in the software license.
- Results in the form of source code, and any documents pertaining to the source code, delivered to
the customer shall be published, publicly available, on the supplier’s public website. The supplier
shall publish the Results within 30 days after the customer’s acceptance of delivery and be
available throughout the Framework Agreement period.
- The supplier is responsible for ensuring that they have obtained the rights necessary for the
execution of the assignment and delivery. The Supplier is also responsible for ensuring that the
customer is not required to have any additional license or pay royalty payments for the customer’s
use of the Result.

In addition, a model contract has been made available. It can serve as a starting point for the
substantive agreement, elaborating the details in various annexes.
